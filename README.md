# Wireless-Sensor-Network
The objective of this project is to implement a base station receiver for a wireless sensor network. There are multiple virtual sensor nodes whos send data packets to the receiver station. The receiver station decodes these messages and displays them on screen.

Prog1.c accepts data packets and sends the packet to PktParser.c for parsing. After data packet is parsed by PktParser.c the appropriate message is displayed on the screen by Prog1.c
